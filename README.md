# [UnysonPlus](https://github.com/jonmlas/UnysonPlus) Framework

UnysonPlus is a community-maintained fork of the original [Unyson](https://wordpress.org/plugins/unyson/) framework for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/).  

This project continues where the original Unyson (by [ThemeFuse](http://themefuse.com/)) left off after development was discontinued, with the goal of keeping the framework alive, stable, and more developer-friendly.
