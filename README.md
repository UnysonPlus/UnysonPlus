UnysonPlus is a community-maintained fork of the original [Unyson](https://wordpress.org/plugins/unyson/) framework for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/).  

<<<<<<< HEAD
This framework was created from the ground up by the team behind [UnysonPlus Community](http://themefuse.com/) from the desire to empower developers to build outstanding WordPress themes fast and easy.
=======
This project continues where the original Unyson (by [ThemeFuse](http://themefuse.com/)) left off after development was discontinued, with the goal of keeping the framework alive, stable, and more developer-friendly.
