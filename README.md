# [Unyson+](https://github.com/jonmlas/Unyson+) Framework

Unyson+ is a **community-maintained fork** of the original [Unyson](https://wordpress.org/plugins/unyson/) framework for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/).  

This project continues where the original Unyson (by [ThemeFuse](http://themefuse.com/)) left off after development was discontinued, with the goal of keeping the framework alive, stable, and more developer-friendly.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Differences from the Original Unyson
* Removed Brizy and all references to it.
* Updated to PHP 7.4+/8.x compatible. Dropped support for PHP 5.6/7.0/7.1/7.2/7.3.
* Ongoing compatibility work with **modern PHP (8.x+)**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Plans for This Project
* **Full PHP 8.x+ support**: update and refactor functions (`create_function`, `each`, curly braces `{}`, `implode()` argument order, etc.).
* Upgrade from **Bootstrap 3 â†’ Bootstrap 5**.
* **Shortcode improvements**: add more features, flexibility, and developer-friendly APIs.
* **Gutenberg integration**: improve compatibility with the Block Editor while keeping Classic Editor support.
* **Modernize the codebase**:
  - Remove deprecated PHP patterns.
  - Add strict typing where possible.
  - Ensure better code organization and readability.
* **Upgrade dependencies**:
  - jQuery usage cleanup.
  - Keep Bootstrap updated to the latest stable version.
* **Options Framework improvements**: make the admin options system more developer-friendly (inspired by ACF / Carbon Fields).
* **Migration tools**: help existing Unyson users transition smoothly to Unyson+ without breaking sites.
* **Automated testing**: introduce PHPUnit + WordPress test suite for long-term stability.
* **Changelog and releases**: maintain semantic versioning (e.g., v1.1.0, v1.2.0).
* **Extension registry**: create an open system for community-driven add-ons and modules.
* **Multisite support**: ensure full compatibility in multisite environments.
* **Backward compatibility**: maintain support for legacy themes and shortcodes while adding modern features.

## Installation

1. Download or clone the repository into your WordPress `plugins` directory.
2. Activate **Unyson+** from the WordPress dashboard under **Plugins**.
3. Configure the framework by going to the **Unyson+ menu**.

âš  Warning: If you currently have the original Unyson plugin installed, create a staging site or backup your site first. Unyson+ shares the same function names as Unyson, so running both at the same time will cause fatal errors. Uninstall Unyson before installing Unyson+.

## Documentation

Currently, the original Unyson documentation is still a useful reference:  
ðŸ‘‰ http://manual.unyson.io/  
 
Future Unyson+-specific documentation will be published here in the repositoryâ€™s **/docs** folder. Contributions are welcome.

## Extensions

Unyson+ supports the same modular extension system as the original Unyson. Extensions can be enabled/disabled as needed.  
We aim to gradually improve, fix, and modernize these extensions.  

Examples include:

- Page Builder  
- Shortcodes  
- Mega Menu  
- Sidebars  
- Sliders  
- Portfolio  
- Backup & Demo Content  
- SEO  
- Forms  
- Feedback  
- Breadcrumbs  
- Events  
- Analytics  
- Mailer  
- Social

- Translation  

ðŸ‘‰ Over time, Unyson+ will host updated and modernized versions of these extensions here under separate repositories for easier maintenance.
